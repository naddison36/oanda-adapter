oanda-adapter
=============

This is a fork of the [oanda-adapter](https://github.com/Cloud9Trader/oanda-adapter), which is a node.js adapter for Oanda's REST and streaming API

The main reason for the fork was to replace the console.log calls with a configurable [logger](https://github.com/naddison36/logger).

Please see the original [oanda-adapter](https://github.com/Cloud9Trader/oanda-adapter) documentation for how to use the adapter and [OANDA's API documention](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live/development-guide/)
